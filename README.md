### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ I'm Victoria! Welcome to my GitHub profile. Happy to have you here! âœ¨

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science with HyperionDev. You can look at some of my projects in my [CapstoneProjects](https://github.com/victoriadw/CapstoneProjects) repository! ðŸŒ±

ðŸ“« I'm looking for an entry-level role in the tech industry, in software engineering or something similar! You can find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-daramy-williams/). ðŸ“«

ðŸ”­ I mainly code in Python and MATLAB, but I am open to learning other programming languages. Maybe I'll explore C++ next? ðŸ”­
